# Custom Splash Screens
This is a list of *very similar* themes that I created for Powercord. They all modify the splash screen.

**Note:** My screenshot tool is bad and the previews look basically the same, *but* they are not the same, I recommend testing them to see the difference.

## Splashes
- **One Dark Splash Screen** \
  A splash screen theme inspired by Atom's One Dark \
